# React + Vite


Live Demo-[website](https://tailwind-nike-website.netlify.app/)

My Project <br>
For practice with frontend design and markup, I built a Nike website using React, Vite, and TailwindCSS.<br>
This project helped me strengthen my skills in responsive design, component architecture, and modern styling techniques.<br>
The application includes a sleek, user-friendly interface that showcases Nike products, utilizing TailwindCSS for quick styling and a consistent design system<br>
